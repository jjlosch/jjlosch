### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Jeremiah (He/Him). Welcome to my page.
I'm currently a student at Iowa State University working towards a degree in Aerospace Engineering and am excited to work towards improving my programming skills. I'm not currently working on any projects outside of school but am always looking for something cool to do.

## Hobbies and Interests
I enjoy staying active, so some of my favorite activities include rock climbing, skateboarding, snowboarding, and ice skating.
I also like to play video games, board games, and card games. Some of my favorite books include the wheel of time series and just about anything written by Brandon Sanderson (I'm a big fantasy and scifi nerd).
